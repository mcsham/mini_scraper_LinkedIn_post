https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinor-restelica/recent-activity/all/;Rinor Restelica;"🤯 This Guy Taught AI How to Read Handwriting...Back in 1993!

Back in 1993, a 32-year-old researcher at AT&T Bell Labs did something incredible. 

He built the first CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that could actually understand handwritten numbers. Think about that for a second. Handwriting is messy, variable, and complex. Teaching a computer to decipher it was a huge leap.

This breakthrough, called LeNet, wasn't just some lab experiment. It actually got used by banks to process millions of checks. It took something that seemed like science fiction and made it an everyday reality.

It's amazing to think how far AI has come since then. 

But this story reminds us that even the biggest advancements often start with one person, one idea, and a lot of hard work. 

It makes you wonder what seemingly impossible things are being worked on right now that we'll take for granted in the future.

What everyday task would you want AI to take on next?

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinor-restelica/recent-activity/all/;Rinor Restelica;"Reid Hoffman LinkedIn’s Founder, Shows Why Leaders Need to Stay Grounded

Reid Hoffman, just dropped a masterclass in this video.

Here’s why it’s worth your time: 

•Approachable Leadership
Reid’s simplicity and relatability stand out. No pretense, no ego - just a genuine conversation about the future. It’s a reminder that great leaders don’t need to be distant or intimidating. 

•AI Insights
Reid is deeply invested in understanding how AI will reshape business and society. 

A few key takeaways from the video: 
 
- AI will act as a “co-pilot” for professionals, enhancing creativity and decision-making.
- It’s not about replacing humans but “amplifying human potential” - think of it as a tool to solve problems faster and smarter. 
- The risks are real, but so are the opportunities. We need to design AI systems that “keep humanity connected”, not isolated. 

•Staying Ahead of Trends
Reid’s ability to stay updated with the latest trends, from AI to social media, is a lesson for all leaders. He doesn’t just talk about the future - he’s actively shaping it. 

His approach is a blueprint for modern leadership - grounded, forward-thinking, and deeply human. 

Leaders, take note.

The SoftFoot Pro, a prosthetic foot, It works without motors, just pure engineering genius, copying how a real foot moves.

Here's why it's so special:

1/ It has a built-in mechanism that stores and releases energy, just like our feet do.

2/ It adapts to uneven ground, something regular prosthetics struggle with.

3/ It's lightweight but super strong, supporting up to 100kg.

4/ It's basically AI, but in its purest form, not software, but smart design.

This is biomimicry at its finest. We're learning from nature to build tech that moves and balances just like us. It's a foot designed for humans, but also for the future of robots.

What other human abilities do you think technology should try to copy next?

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinor-restelica/recent-activity/all/;Rinor Restelica;"The Power of Appreciation

It's Not Always About Money.

In today's world, we often focus on the material, on bonuses and raises. But the most valuable currency is often the simplest: genuine appreciation.

People don't leave jobs, they leave environments where they feel unseen and undervalued.

When you make people feel appreciated, you're not just boosting their morale, you're building loyalty, enhancing productivity, and creating a culture of success.

It's not about grand gestures. It's about the small, consistent efforts to make people feel valued and heard.

So, take a moment today to think about the people in your life - your team, your family, your friends. 

Who can you show appreciation for today?

2025 is here, and the telecom industry faces its toughest challenges yet. 

EY’s Top 10 Risks for Telecommunications 2025 highlights a new reality: faster networks alone won’t save telcos—it’s how they navigate trust, talent, and transformation that will define their future.

Here’s what stands out:

📌 𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐥𝐞. 66% of customers want telcos to explain how they use AI, and cyberattacks like DDoS are targeting the sector more than any other. Security isn’t just an IT issue—it’s a trust imperative.

📌 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐚𝐩 𝐢𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠. While 73% of leaders prioritize hiring and reskilling, 85% of employees say HR needs an overhaul. The industry must redefine how it attracts, retains, and inspires talent in an increasingly digital world.

📌 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞-𝐨𝐫-𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤. AI could double efficiency within five years, but legacy systems and poorly aligned KPIs threaten to derail progress. Telcos need a roadmap that balances innovation with execution.

The question isn’t whether telcos will face these challenges—it’s whether they’ll adapt fast enough to overcome them.

🔗 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞: https://bit.ly/4aLuJcZ

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤? 

Are telcos ready to rebuild trust, reskill talent, and redefine themselves—or are we underestimating the uphill battle ahead? 

Let’s discuss.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewamann/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Amann;"You are all using Deep Research Wrong. 

Its not a tool to be used to ""generate a report"" for you to publish something online - or to create thought provoking LinkedIn Articles for other humans to read.

ChatGPT Deep research is an INPUT to a process.

If i wanted to acquire a Marketing Agency as an additional service for NineTwoThree (We did this in 2023) then I would ask Deep Research to be an INPUT to my decision.

- I would ask it to go research previous acquisitions. What size were those companies, what benefits did they see?
- I would craft a second prompt to go research the current market and what type of marketing agencies succeed in 2025.
- I would craft yet another prompt to analyze my financials, compare that to industry standards, and understand my P&L and our ratios.
- I would craft YET ANOTHER prompt to go into details with our current clients, their sentiment on our projects, how long we keep them etc.

Then, I'd summarize each result into a report, create a project in ChatGPT and ask just regular old ChatGPT o1 to have a conversation with me about the decision.

And thinking this further - I probably would have done this entire thing in Gemini and AI Studio and kept everything inside of Google Drive nice and secure and safe.

That's what you should be using Deep Research for - not LinkedIn articles.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewamann_you-are-all-using-deep-research-wrong-activity-7293645953125765121-w0d2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewamann/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Amann;"One of the biggest misconceptions of working with an AI agency is that we don’t ever want to end the engagement. But that is not the case at NineTwoThree AI Studio. 

We LOVE helping clients maintain our AI solutions on their own after we launch them.

(Keep in mind we’ve created dozens of successful, profitable enterprise AI products)

Think about it. We’re taking projects from idea to production. If our clients are considering hiring an in-house team, it means that:
- The project was a success
- The product has traction and users
- The client has faith they can take it to the next level

That’s a complete win in my book. 

That’s why we help train the engineers and product folks of our clients on the AI Solutions we built them. We’ve even done workshops, training and knowledge transfer sessions. And we manage the whole timeline.

As with all of our contracts, our clients own the code we develop. And now, they have a perfectly capable in-house team to build on top of their already profitable project.

That’s a real partnership. 

Our interests are in making you successful, not in getting another 12-month contract.

I’m proud of our approach.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewamann_one-of-the-biggest-misconceptions-of-working-activity-7293308795663912962-7gzi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewamann/recent-activity/all/;Brandon Pizzacalla;"For the past couple of months we've been heads-down building an AI content platform at Contently, and it's been way harder than I thought.

You'd think, ""AI writes copy, so building a platform around it should be easy, right?"" 

Wrong. 

It's way more complex than I imagined, especially when you're building for large enterprises.

Here's why: It's not just about generating text. That is obviously easy.

There's the LLMO (large language model optimization) aspect. We need to generate content that will get companies and products into LLMs and search results.

It's also about bank-grade security to protect sensitive data. Think secure approval workflows, because these companies need tight control over their messaging. 

And then there's the nuance of language.. accurately matching style and tone, avoiding specific words and phrases, ensuring everything stays on brand and in a specific writers voice. 

We even had to build a search-enabled fact-checking agent to make sure statements generated are true.

You can't have a national bank putting out content with false statements...

The entire thing is a series of interconnected AI agents that work together to write and iterate on a piece of content. 

So, it's not as simple as plugging into an AI API. 

We're carefully crafting a solution that empowers businesses to create high-quality content while maintaining complete control. 

Trying for the best of both worlds: AI-driven efficiency and enterprise-grade reliability. 

We even had to build this AI externally to our core platform, ensuring our customers' data is never unintentionally accessed by the AI.

So, while the journey has been slower than expected, I've also learned a ton. And I'm excited about our direction.

We're building something truly unique, something that will change the way enterprises create content.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bpizzacalla_for-the-past-couple-of-months-weve-been-activity-7292554246544130050-Glo0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewamann/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Amann;"What happens when humans aren’t the most intelligent being on earth?

Let’s go back a few hundred million years.

Imagine if a dinosaur got a hold of transformers and created DinoGPT.

This Dino used millions of Dino knowledge to predict what Dinos will say to each other when prompted. 

Would the result of this technology create the most intelligent species on earth? 

Sure - until Humans came along.

And we know that humans are way smarter than dinosaurs ever were.

Using this analogy as humans venture to create the next intelligent species, it becomes familiar to build the future based on human capabilities.. 

Inherently, we understand that this world is run by humans…so navigating our spaces like a human makes sense.

But what if there’s a better intelligence?

One that you or I cannot fathom - but is exponentially smarter than all of us humans. 

Maybe this intelligence understands gravity equations and quantum mechanics, or has discovered worm holes and what exists 20,000 feet under the sea.

What if the smartest intelligence is non-human?

It's something to think about, especially if your name is Sam. 

Because the race to AGI might just lead you to create another human that is, well, human.

There are a few companies that I met at CES that are building for different types of intelligence. 

And they’re starting to see signs of problem solving that are just not possible in our mathematical representation of the world.

For some reason, I have a feeling that the smartest AI will be non-human based. 

This earth went through 5 extinction events, and then left us humans to build our own replacement…it seems comedic.

I'm not arguing for either side - it's just an interesting thought experiment.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewamann_what-happens-when-humans-arent-the-most-activity-7291834077693788160-Hg69?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewamann/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Amann;"The internet is in a weird spot right now. APIs were the gold standard for computers talking to computers. But now, things are changing.

Let me put it this way. Websites right now have three things they present to any application trying to access them:

Sitemap
A robots.txt file
API documentation

They all give instructions for web crawlers and interface crawlers to say “This is how you interact with my data.”

But new agentic approaches like ChatGPT’s Operator are different. It’s a crawler trying to appear like a human. “Hi, I’m Andrew Amann(‘s agent), please let me in.”

So, if agents are supposed to represent humans, we have to figure out how agents talk to websites. Something like an agents.web file. In that file are specific instructions for AGENTS of what they can do on that website. That’s the new API.

Any agent asking for information gets a set of instructions from the website that say “Okay, if you’re acting as Andrew, here’s the information you can see, and what you can do.”

Darmesh Shah thinks agents will self-identify. But I think websites will start serving our agents user-specific applets.

Let’s take Uber as an example. Uber’s business model depends on a human looking at the screen. That’s where all those ads are, and all the calls-to-action to order food delivery when you get back from the bars. $145 billion worth of screen real estate.

So, how do they preserve their business model? Embrace agents. If I want to order an Uber through an AI agent, I’d get a verified applet tied to my device’s MAC address, giving me multi-step processes (like a dinner reservation, ride-share, and babysitting) verified to my identity. 

And I see these applets, and click approve on each step. 

That’s how I interact with an agentic future.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewamann_the-internet-is-in-a-weird-spot-right-now-activity-7291471686523080705-EWmN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman/recent-activity/all/;Lex Fridman;"Narendra Modi is one of the most fascinating human beings I have ever studied.

I can't wait to talk to him on podcast in a few weeks.

On top of the complex, deep history of India, and his role in it, just the human side of Modi is really interesting. For example, he has often done multi-day fasts (9+ days 🤯) for spiritual reasons. I fast often as well. So I'll do a 48-72 hour fast once I arrive to India before talking to him. It's a good opportunity to meditate, and to reflect on how incredibly lucky I am to be alive, to have the weird brain that sees so much beauty in the world even though I've increasingly seen a lot of the darker sides of human nature. And most of all... To reflect on how lucky I am to have so much love in my life.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/fei-fei-li-4541247/recent-activity/all/;Andreessen Horowitz;"We've known World Labs cofounder Fei-Fei Li for nearly two decades. She was joining Stanford as a new professor while a16z’s Martin Casado was just leaving to do his own startup. And she has advised the firm on AI many times in the past.

Now, we are thrilled to partner with her and co-founders Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, Ben Mildenhall and the world-class team at World Labs, with our latest investment.

Alongside language, there has been a “pixel” revolution in generative AI, allowing us to create images and videos from text descriptions of what we want to see. Unlike language models, these generated images are reflections of the physical world. 

But while these sorts of models are tremendously useful for creating images and videos, none are quite as general as LLMs are for language. For example, none can create a true 3D representation of a world you can walk through, interact with, and build upon — something that isn’t just confined to a screen, but an actual representation of the real world (or perhaps a generated virtual world), that sits within a computer, and allows for reasoning about physics and cause-and-effect.

It is this problem that brings us to World Labs.

At this point, the company is deep at work pushing the frontiers of the spatial intelligence problem. They’re building a foundation model that can generate 3D interactive worlds which are the basis for spatial reasoning.

We are honored to be part of it.

#AI? My own answer is Spatial Intelligence - a technology that could empower and enable countless possible use cases in creation, design, learning, AR/VR, robotics, and beyond. It’s a real honor that my cofounders Justin Johnson Christoph Lassner Ben Mildenhall and I are joined by a formidable team of world class pixel talents to start World Labs to work on this super hard problem that took Mother Nature half a billion years to solve.
Today we are announcing the formation of World Labs, a spatial intelligence company building Large World Models (LWMs) to perceive, generate, and interact with the 3D world. We aim to lift AI models from the 2D plane of pixels to full 3D worlds – both virtual and real – endowing them with spatial intelligence as rich as our own. Human spatial intelligence evolved over millennia; but in this time of extraordinary progress, we see the opportunity to imbue AI with this ability in the near term.

World Labs was founded by visionary AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li along with Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall; each a world-renowned technologist in computer vision and graphics. We are bringing together the most formidable slate of pixel talent ever assembled – from AI research to systems engineering to product design – and we are hiring.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowancheung/recent-activity/all/;Rowan Cheung;"BREAKING: OpenAI just launched ChatGPT Operator, a new AI agent that can autonomously take action across the web on your behalf.

I got early access, and here are 9 impressive use cases I found:

1. Ordering dinner ingredients to my house based on a picture and a recipe (video attached)

2. Planning a weekend trip based on hidden gems, my budget and interests. At 0:06, ChatGPT Operator was blocked from Reddit but then decided to just do a Bing search with ""Reddit"" at the end: https://lnkd.in/gqqDCGV3

3. Crypto investment research based on tokens that are actually worth looking into. ChatGPT Operator got hit with a ""Are you human"" CAPTCHA, then pinged me to take control to confirm: https://lnkd.in/gtfpZV99

4. Booking a one-way flight from Zurich to Vienna using the Booking integration: https://lnkd.in/gZypshPg

5. Scheduling an appointment with my barber after looking at my Google Calendar schedule/availability: https://lnkd.in/gTVNnmgz

6. Researching a good birthday gift for my mom based on what she likes and finding the best deals for those items across the internet: https://lnkd.in/gTJXZvHg

7. Booking a one-time house cleaner for my home through the Thumbtack integration based on my budget: https://lnkd.in/gQAMx6WX

8. Finding the best/cheapest health insurance coverage in Switzerland (an interesting one since most prices are not publicly available and gated behind a meeting): https://lnkd.in/gh3WDq26

9. Finding a top-rated dog walker in Vancouver BC and presenting me with 3 top options: https://lnkd.in/gQNpgKgY

Overall, I was very impressed by the research preview of Operator.

I loved that it can do tasks for me as I do other work, and simply ping me when it needs me to ""take over"". I also really enjoyed the saved tasks tab, and adding Custom Instructions for specific websites.

But it's important to note that Operator is still a research preview and is improving.

I found that:

-Quite a few sites were blocked after they detected the AI
-There's a limited set of partner integrations
-It's true purpose is to take actions across the web

Operator *operates* within ChatGPT, but it's a completely different tool.

Its output lengths are small, and its true purpose is to take actions across the web (typing, clicking, scrolling). Meaning it's not like ChatGPT, which can produce essays and write long code.

The future of tech work is here. And personally, I'm incredibly excited about it.

Agents can do the boring work, so I can spend more time doing what I love.

I'll be publicly sharing all the ways I automate my work with agents, so follow me Rowan Cheung and join my newsletter The Rundown AI for more.";https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rowancheung_breaking-openai-just-launched-chatgpt-operator-activity-7288257606744190977-eThB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Ng;"A “10x engineer” — a widely accepted concept in tech — purportedly has 10 times the impact of the average engineer. But we don’t seem to talk about 10x marketers, 10x recruiters, or 10x financial analysts. As more jobs become AI enabled, I think this will change, and there will be a lot more “10x professionals.”

There aren’t already more 10x professionals because, in many roles, the gap between the best and the average worker has a ceiling. No matter how athletic a supermarket checkout clerk is, they’re not likely to scan groceries so fast that customers get out of the store 10x faster. Similarly, even the best doctor is unlikely to make patients heal 10x faster than an average one (but to a sick patient, even a small difference is worth a lot). In many jobs, the laws of physics place a limit on what any human or AI can do (unless we completely reimagine that job).

But for many jobs that primarily involve applying knowledge or processing information, AI will be transformative. In a few roles, I’m starting to see tech-savvy individuals coordinate a suite of technology tools to do things differently and start to have, if not yet 10x impact, then easily 2x impact. I expect this gap to grow.

10x engineers don’t write code 10 times faster. Instead, they make technical architecture decisions that result in dramatically better downstream impact, they spot problems and prioritize tasks more effectively, and instead of rewriting 10,000 lines of code (or labeling 10,000 training examples) they might figure out how to write just 100 lines (or collect 100 examples) to get the job done.

I think 10x marketers, recruiters, and analysts will, similarly, do things differently. For example, perhaps traditional marketers repeatedly write social media posts. 10x marketers might use AI to help write, but the transformation will go deeper than that. If they are deeply sophisticated in how to apply AI — ideally able to write code themselves to test ideas, automate tasks, or analyze data — they might end up running a lot more experiments, get better insights about what customers want, and generate much more precise or personalized messages than a traditional marketer, and thereby end up making 10x impact.

Similarly, 10x recruiters won’t just use generative AI to help write emails to candidates or summarize interviews. (This level of use of prompting-based AI will soon become table stakes for many knowledge roles.) They might coordinate a suite of AI tools to identify and carry out research on a large set of candidates, enabling them to have dramatically greater impact than the average recruiter. And 10x analysts won’t just use generative AI to edit their reports. They might write code to orchestrate a suite of AI agents to do deep research into the products, markets, and companies, and thereby derive far more valuable conclusions than someone who does research the traditional way.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/recent-activity/all/;Andrew Ng;"Announcing How Transformer LLMs Work, created with Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst, co-authors of the beautifully illustrated book, “Hands-On Large Language Models.”

This course offers a deep dive into the inner workings of the transformer architecture that powers large language models (LLMs).

The transformer architecture revolutionized generative AI; in fact, the ""GPT"" in ChatGPT stands for ""Generative Pre-Trained Transformer."" Originally introduced in the Google Brain team's groundbreaking 2017 paper ""Attention Is All You Need,"" by Vaswani and others, transformers were a highly scalable model for machine translation tasks. Variants of this architecture now power today’s LLMs such as those from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Cohere, Anthropic and DeepSeek.

In this course, you’ll learn in detail how LLMs process text. You'll also work through code examples that illustrate that transformer's individual components.

In details, you’ll learn:
- How the representation of language has evolved, from Bag-of-Words to Word2Vec embeddings to the transformer architecture that captures a word's meanings taking into account the context of other words in the input.
- How inputs are broken down into tokens before they are sent to the language model.
- The details of a transformer's main stages: Tokenization and embedding, the stack of transformer blocks, and the language model head.
- The inner workings of the transformer block, including attention, which calculates relevance scores, and the feedforward layer, which incorporates stored information learned in training.
- How cached calculations make transformers faster.
- Some of the most recent ideas in the latest models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which uses multiple sub-models and a router on each layer to improve the quality of LLMs.

By the end of this course, you’ll have a deep understanding of how LLMs actually process text and be able to read through papers describing the latest models and understand the details.

Gaining this intuition will improve your approach to building LLM applications.
